## Download & Install

The latest version of Harvest CCS is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux on the [releases page](https://github.com/matthew-collett/harvest-ccs/releases).

Note: On macOS, you may get "Application Is Damaged and Canâ€™t Be Opened. You Should Move It To The Trash". This is just because I don't want to pay $100 to Apple to have this application notarized. A work-around is to simply run

```bash
`xattr -c '/Applications/Harvest Competition Control System.app'`
```
